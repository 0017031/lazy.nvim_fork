## âœ… TODO

- [x] fancy UI to manage all your Neovim plugins
- [x] auto lazy-loading of lua modules
- [x] lazy-loading on events, commands, filetypes and key mappings
- [x] Partial clones instead of shallow clones
- [x] waits till missing deps are installed (bootstrap Neovim and start using it right away)
- [x] Async
- [x] No need to manually compile
- [x] Fast. Automatically caches and compiles byte code of all lua modules needed during startup
- [x] Correct sequencing of dependencies (deps should always be opt. Maybe make everything opt?)
- [x] Config in multiple files
- [x] dev option and patterns for local packages
- [x] Profiling
- [x] lockfile `lazy-lock.json`
- [x] upvalues in `config` & `init`
- [x] automatically check for updates
- [x] commit, branch, tag, version and full semver support
- [x] statusline component to see number of pending updates

- [x] semver https://devhints.io/semver
- [x] auto-loading on completion for lazy-loaded commands
- [x] bootstrap code
- [x] Background update checker
- [x] health checks: check merge conflicts async
  - [x] unsupported props or props from other managers
  - [x] other packages still in site?
  - [x] other package manager artifacts still present? compiled etc
- [x] status page showing running handlers and cache stats
- [x] temp colorscheme used during startup when installing missing plugins
- [x] automatically reloads when config changes are detected
- [x] handlers imply opt
- [x] dependencies imply opt for deps
- [ ] show spec errors in health
- [ ] fix plugin details
- [ ] show disabled plugins (strikethrough?)
- [ ] log file
- [ ] git tests
- [ ] Import specs from other plugin managers
- [ ] [packspec](https://github.com/nvim-lua/nvim-package-specification)
  - [ ] add support to specify `engines`, `os` and `cpu` like in `package.json`
  - [ ] semver merging. Should check if two or more semver ranges are compatible and calculate the union range
    - default semver merging strategy: if no version matches all, then use highest version?
  - [ ] package meta index (package.lua cache for all packages)
